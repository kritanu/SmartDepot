### Finalists (Top 6) in the The power of connected hackathon by Honeywell

* Climate Sensing using IoT.
* Intruder Detection using Computer Vision.
* Supply Chain Management using Blockchain.


**How it works**

* Climate sensing is done by a sensor on the raspberri pi which constantly returns the temperature and humidity value.

* The intruder detection does motion detection using openCV. When an intruder is detected, it triggers a simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP)
